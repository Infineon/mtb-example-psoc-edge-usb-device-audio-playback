# PSOC&trade; Edge MCU: Audio playback using emUSB-device

This code example demonstrates how to setup the USB block of PSOC&trade; Edge MCU using Segger's emUSB-device middleware.

In this code example PSOC&trade; Edge MCU enumerates as a USB Audio Class (UAC) device with HID consumer control over the USB interface. This code example uses FreeRTOS. The PC host sees the device as:
- Audio playback device
- Microphone/recording device
- Consumer control device for volume control

This code example has a three project structure: CM33 secure, CM33 non-secure, and CM55 projects. All three projects are programmed to the external QSPI flash and executed in Execute in Place (XIP) mode. Extended boot launches the CM33 secure project from a fixed location in the external flash, which then configures the protection settings and launches the CM33 non-secure application. Additionally, CM33 non-secure application enables CM55 CPU and launches the CM55 application.
> **Note:** On the KIT_PSE84_HMI, all three projects are programmed to the external OSPI flash instead of QSPI.

See the [Design and implementation](docs/design_and_implementation.md) for the functional description of this code example.


## Requirements

- [ModusToolbox&trade;](https://www.infineon.com/modustoolbox) v3.7 or later (tested with v3.8)
- Board support package (BSP) minimum required version: 1.0.0
- Programming language: C
- Associated parts: All [PSOC&trade; Edge MCU](https://www.infineon.com/products/microcontroller/32-bit-psoc-arm-cortex/32-bit-psoc-edge-arm) parts


## Supported toolchains (make variable 'TOOLCHAIN')

- GNU Arm&reg; Embedded Compiler v14.2.1 (`GCC_ARM`) – Default value of `TOOLCHAIN`
- Arm&reg; Compiler v6.22 (`ARM`)
- IAR C/C++ Compiler v9.50.2 (`IAR`)
- LLVM Embedded Toolchain for Arm&reg; v19.1.5 (`LLVM_ARM`)


## Supported kits (make variable 'TARGET')

- [PSOC&trade; Edge E84 Evaluation Kit](https://www.infineon.com/KIT_PSE84_EVAL) (`KIT_PSE84_EVAL_EPC2`) – Default value of `TARGET`
- [PSOC&trade; Edge E84 Evaluation Kit](https://www.infineon.com/KIT_PSE84_EVAL) (`KIT_PSE84_EVAL_EPC4`)
- [PSOC&trade; Edge E84 HMI Kit](https://www.infineon.com/KIT_PSE84_HMI) (`KIT_PSE84_HMI`)

## Hardware setup

This example uses the board's default configuration. See the kit user guide to ensure that the board is configured correctly.

Ensure the following jumper and pin configuration on board.
- BOOT SW must be in the HIGH/ON position
- J20 and J21 must be in the tristate/not connected (NC) position for the PSOC&trade; Edge E84 Evaluation Kit


## Software setup

See the [ModusToolbox&trade; tools package installation guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxInstallguide) for information about installing and configuring the tools package.

Install a terminal emulator if you do not have one. Instructions in this document use [Tera Term](https://teratermproject.github.io/index-en.html).

This example requires no additional software or tools.


## Operation

See [Using the code example](docs/using_the_code_example.md) for instructions on creating a project, opening it in various supported IDEs, and performing tasks, such as building, programming, and debugging the application within the respective IDEs.

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector

2. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud

3. After programming, the application starts automatically. Confirm that "PSOC Edge MCU: Audio Playback using emUSB-device" is displayed on the UART terminal

   **Figure 1. USB audio playback device startup**

4. Connect the kit to the PC using another USB cable plugged into the USB device connector shown in **Figure 2**

   **Figure 2. USB-device port**

   ![](images/kit-usb-device-port.png)

5. On the Windows system, verify that a new USB device is enumerated as a microphone and named as "USB Audio Playback"

   **Figure 3. USB audio device enumeration**

   ![](images/usbd-audio-recorder-enumeration.png)

6. Note that the kit's user LED (LED1) is turned OFF and a "USB Audio Device Connected" status is displayed on the serial terminal as shown in **Figure 4**

   **Figure 4. USB audio device connected**

7. Open an audio software tool in the computer. This code example uses [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) to verify the IN (recording) and OUT (playback through kit speaker) flows. Select the correct microphone and playback device in Audacity. Also, ensure the stereo configuration of recording channel as show in **Figure 5**

   **Figure 5. USB audio device connected**

   ![](images/audacity.png)

8. In Audacity, press **Record** ![](images/record.png) to record sound from PDM microphones. Stop at any time by pressing **Stop** ![](images/stop.png). Press **Play** ![](images/play.png) to play the recorded audio through kit speaker. **Figure 6** shows the location of PDM microphones and speaker

9. Press the left USER BTN1 in the kit to increase and USER BTN2 to decrease volume (as shown below). The volume levels will be displayed on the host PC.
